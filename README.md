# Airplane Traffic Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates airplane traffic by pulling real-time data from the OpenSky API network. Each airplane is represented as a separate thread, allowing for realistic traffic simulation where collisions may occur. Users can configure various start parameters to customize the simulation.

## Features
- Real-time data integration with the OpenSky API
- Each airplane operates as an independent thread
- User-configurable start parameters
- Collision detection and simulation

## Acknowledgments
- OpenSky Network for providing the API.
